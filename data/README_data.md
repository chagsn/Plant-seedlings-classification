The dataset at the basis of the project is the Kaggle "V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset" avalaible at:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset  

It was built and made publicly available by Aarhus University in Danemark.
The previous (V1) version of this dataset was used in the Plant Seedling Classification playground competition on Kaggle.

Each class contains rgb images (PNG format) that show plants at different growth stages.
